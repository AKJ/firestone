Hearthstone collection companion for Overwolf

For now it tells you, when you open a pack, if the cards you get are new cards or simply dust.

Later on, I'm planning on enhancing the app with all the features you expect from a collection companion: browse & search your collection, get info on its completion status, import and export decks without needing to leave the game.
