Hearthstone collection companion for Overwolf

For now it tells you, when you open a pack, if the cards you get are new cards or simply dust.

The image detection is still not fully reliable (thank you moving images), so sometimes you need to click twice to get the notification, and it also happens that you get a notification for a card you haven't revealed yet.
Fixing this is the next step on the To-Do list.

Later on, I'm planning on enhancing the app with all the features you expect from a collection companion: browse & search your collection, get info on its completion status, import and export decks without needing to leave the game.
