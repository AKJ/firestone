# What is HS Collection Companion?

HS Collection Companion is an app you run on Overwolf alongside Hearthstone (like HearthArena).

It monitors the packs you open and tells you if the cards you receive are new cards or are just dust because you already have the maximum number of copies of the card.

The long-term goal is to provide other features needed by players who want to manage their collection, such as stats, missing cards, and so on.

Please don't hesitate to request new features or report issues using the issues link above.
