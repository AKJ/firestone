We're opening a beta-tester program! If you're interested in helping Firestone development by reporting issues on the next versions (and having exclusive sneak peaks of what's ahead), just let me know [on Discord](https://discord.gg/FhEHn8w).

# How to become a beta tester

Just ping me (@sebastientromp) [on Discord](https://discord.gg/FhEHn8w).

# What being a beta-tester means

-   You will have a specific role on the Discord, and access to a private beta-tester channel
-   You will have the opportunity to manually install new Firestone releases before they are officially up
-   Please provide feedback on the private Discord channel when you encounter bugs, or things that don't work as you expect, or basically anything you think could improve the overall app

# How to install new releases

-   Install the version from https://download.overwolf.com/install/Download?ExtensionId=lnknbakkpommmjjdnelmfbjjdbocfpnpbkijjnob&app_channel=beta. This will let you benefit from auto-updates for beta builds.

## The manual way (no auto updates)

-   Please consider using the method above instead, as I don't publish all intermediate beta versions on Github.
-   First you need to install the official release at least once (you can't install the beta if you have never installed the official Firestone app). You can download it from there: https://www.firestoneapp.com
-   Download the latest release from https://github.com/Zero-to-Heroes/firestone/releases (or, more likely, I will provide you with a direct link to the release to download). You're looking to download the `.opk` file, which is a zipped release that can be installed by Overwolf.
-   Double click on the downloaded .opk file, and follow the instructions
-   Once an official release is out, you may want to uninstall / reinstall the app to be sure you have the final version (you won't lose any progress made).
